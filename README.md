*Developing scraping tool for stackoverflow questions(mini-project)*
Web scraping is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites. This technique mostly focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet).

__Uses:__ When performing data science tasks, it's common to want to use data found on the internet. You'll usually be able to access this data in CSV format, or via an Application Programming Interface (API). However, there are times when the data you want can only be accessed as part of a web page. In cases like this, you'll want to use a technique called web scraping to get the data from the web page into a format you can work within your analysis.

__Modules used__
